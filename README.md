# Reason Conversion Coverage Visualizer

This small script generates a visualization of your codebase's conversion progress from JavaScript to Reason.

**THis is just a proof of concept**. It only works on a flat `src` directory.

## Installation & Usage

Clone this directory and invoke the `re-cover` script at the root of the project, where a flat `src/` resides. You can then open `comp.svg` in a browser.

## Prerequisite
**Note**: doesn't work on Windows yet. Contribution welcome!
You need to have GraphViz installed, and the usual `sed, find, grep`.
